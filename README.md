# Todo

- [x] split packages into groups (not tested)
- [x] make paru optional
- [x] apply configs
- [x] run nvm install --lts
- [ ] add docker and run systemctl enable & start
- [ ] add pgadmin
- [ ] check if grimblast installs correctly
- [x] set up dark theme (not tested)
- [x] set clipse config option imageDisplay.type to "kitty"
- [ ] find a way to stay on a magic workspace even on mouse leave from the current window
  - The `special-fallthrough` setting did work, but gotta report the bug anyway
- [x] Separate monitor configuration from `hyprland.conf`
- [ ] Make monitor configuration semi-automatic: find names (probably without hyprctl to allow setting them up without hyprland running), compose the monitors.conf from user input and all that
- [ ] Consider migrating to Quickshell from waybar
- [ ] Nginx config?
- [x] run `link-configs.sh` after `post-install.sh` (not tested)
